## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive podcast analytics and research experiment within Luminate's data science organization. The project focuses on advanced cross-platform podcast performance analysis using data from **5 major platforms**: Spotify, YouTube, Amazon, Apple Podcasts, and iHeart Radio for competitive intelligence, market research, and competitive analysis.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Full 5-platform ranking system with US-normalized consumption data and comprehensive classification (369 shows ranked).

### Key Data Characteristics
- **Spotify**: US-focused, 100 shows, YTD 2025 plays (CONFIDENTIAL)
- **YouTube**: Global scope, 100 shows, US-normalized at 7.5% (15% with additional 50% discount)
- **Amazon**: Global scope, 100 shows, US-normalized at 65% (cleaned from extensive padding)
- **Apple**: Top 30 US podcasts, plays >30s, 2025 data (100% US data)
- **iHeart**: US platform-specific listening data, 150 shows (100% US data)
- **Total Unique Shows**: 369 across all platforms (369 successfully ranked, duplicates fixed)

## Development Guidelines

### Data Analysis Approach
- Use pandas for CSV processing - all data is in CSV format
- Implement data cleaning for Amazon CSV (contains extensive padding/empty rows)
- Handle confidential Spotify data appropriately
- Consider geographic scope differences (US-only vs global) when comparing platforms
- Normalize metrics across different platform measurement systems

### Important Considerations
- **Confidentiality**: Spotify data marked as confidential - handle accordingly
- **Data Quality**: Amazon CSV requires significant cleaning due to row padding
- **Platform Differences**: Each platform uses different metrics and time periods
- **Temporal Scope**: Data primarily covers 2025 YTD through October

### Advanced 5-Platform Ranking System ‚úÖ COMPLETE
The system implements a sophisticated **four-component weighted scoring algorithm** across **ALL 5 MAJOR PLATFORMS** with US-normalized consumption data:

**Scoring Components (Updated Weights):**
1. **Total Consumption Score (65%)** - US-normalized cross-platform audience metrics
2. **Platform Reach Score (20%)** - Best single platform performance relative to others
3. **Platform Count Score (5%)** - Multi-platform presence bonus (up to 5 platforms)
4. **Within-Genre Popularity Score (10%)** - Consumption-based genre ranking

**Geographic Normalization:**
- **YouTube**: 7.5% factor (15% base √ó 50% additional discount = US market estimate)
- **Amazon**: 65% factor (global ‚Üí US estimate)
- **Spotify, Apple, iHeart**: 100% (already US-only data)

**Data Quality Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate Resolution**: Fixed "Morbid" appearing twice (#8 and #10) by implementing proper groupby aggregation
- ‚úÖ **Platform Deduplication**: All platforms now aggregate by normalized show name to handle duplicates
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Matching**: Enhanced show name normalization for accurate matching

**Analysis Capabilities:**
- **Complete cross-platform comparison**: Spotify Plays vs YouTube Views vs Amazon Plays vs Apple Plays vs iHeart Streams
- **Geographic distribution analysis** (22 countries represented)
- **Multi-platform show performance correlation** (up to 5 platforms per show)
- **Genre-specific performance benchmarking** (10 standardized genres)
- **Golden Globes/award eligibility filtering** by country
- **Advanced show name normalization** for accurate cross-platform matching

### Show Name Matching & Normalization
The system uses enhanced normalization for accurate cross-platform matching:
- Removes common suffixes: "Podcast", "Show", "The Podcast", "The Show"
- Removes host qualifiers: "with [host name]", "w/ [host name]"
- Standardizes punctuation and spacing using regex
- **Results**: 370 shows successfully ranked across 369 unique shows identified
