A:        Eligible podcasts will be drawn from a curated list developed by Luminate  based on several key metrics including audience reach,engagement, financial metrics, platform visibility and market presence. Luminate will determine the list of the top 25 podcasts based on this criteriaThe Golden Globes will notify the qualifying podcasts for submission for award consideration.
Q:        Also, more generally, are only creative/narrative podcasts (like audiobooks) eligible, or are podcasts about the industry/ones that interview celebrities also in the running? 
A:        Eligible podcasts include genres and formats including: narrative (both fictional and non-fictional storytelling), scripted, unscripted, hybrid, education or informative, news or current affairs and entertainment and pop culture. Podcasts must consist primarily of original content. Repackaged or rebroadcast content from other media (e.g. film or television content converted to podcasts) is not eligible.
Q:        When you say narrative and video podcasts, that means just narrative, creative or storytelling podcasts that are pre-written? Are popular podcasts such as “Call Her Daddy” and “New Heights" eligible as well, as they have a video component?
A:         Yes, podcasts can be scripted and include video components so long as they are not repurposed film or television content that comprises most of the podcast.
Q:        Are foreign podcasts eligible for consideration?
A:        Yes, the Golden Globes is a global show in every regard. Foreign podcasts, meaning those programs produced outside of the U.S., are eligible if they are a co-production (both financially and creatively) between the U.S. partner and foreign partner. Eligibility of podcasts does not depend on the language(s) used in the program. Non-English language podcasts released in the U.S. are eligible if they meet other qualifying criteria.
Q:        Why did you create a podcast category? Something that is more commonly associated with pop culture awards or tech programs.
A:        As forms of entertainment evolve with technology, the Golden Globes wanted to recognize new forms of storytelling. Podcasts have emerged for sharing narratives and building communities across global borders and generations. By celebrating achievements in both audio and visual podcasts, the Globes aims to honor our heritage categories while making room for new voices and formats to be heard.
Q:        Why are “financial metrics” used as a criterion? What about non-profit podcasts or those that have huge followings but aren’t in it for the money?
A:        In determining the impact and success of a podcast, its financial success is only one of several key metrics. This metric includes measuring subscriber growth on paid platforms, advertising or sponsorship success and growth over the eligibility period. It is not meant to be the sole barometer of success.
Q:        Your rules mention chart rankings on major platforms such as Spotify and iHeart, but what about podcasts that have grown virally and organically through social media platforms such as TikTok and have gained millions of followers? How do you measure that?
A:        Virtually all top-ranking podcasts release episodes on major platforms, sometimes multiples. Platforms also release data used by Luminate in determining visibility and market presence.
Q:        Why is the Golden Globes considering podcasts that are non-entertainment such as news formats? Does that mean a journalistic organization such as a newspaper or broadcast network can submit and win? Wouldn’t it be a conflict of interest if reporters for that organization were also Golden Globe voters?
A:        The Best Podcast award is open across all formats in recognition of the rapid growth and popularity of the medium in all forms. The eligibility list developed by Luminate is drawn from multiple sources and metrics. Each Golden Globe voter is required to declare all potential conflicts of interest prior to voting.
Q:        Who receives the award for best podcast? The show host? What if it’s a panel format? The producer/creator?
A:        The award will be given to the podcast’s consistent host(s) (with respect to hosted podcasts), or the podcast’s production company(ies) (with respect to non-hosted podcasts).
Q:        Your rules state that motion pictures and television programs with production budgets less than $2 million can receive fee alternatives to the $5,000 submission fee per title for the Golden Globe screening platform. Does that mean $2 million for an entire season of a television series or limited series or is that per episode?
A:
